gst posting executive with ACL placed
recurring bills->bills queue->master bills flow
po invoices->bills queue->pos flow
check for recurring bills which dont have images still


1. Adding SBA, Carpet Areas, and floors of all buildings,
2. Remove the decimal values from all totals like above. I see in Payouts and Account Payables, let it the totals be rounded to nearest integer. You can use RoundUp,
3. The description of the report from report perspective. Like say, Whether is it based on expenses paid or yet to pay and so on...
4. (a) Never increase the size of the number card. Let the space be empty is there arent enough number cards to fit. (b) Always show numbers in Lakhs. (c) These big numbers, let there no decimal value.
5. once that duplicate bill data thing is resolved. We will focus on the below in that priority (1) HO expenses - reports and graphs (2) building expenses- report and graphs (3) capex - reports and graphs (4) Bill's and invoice upload data and compliance (5) posting data summary, reports and number cards (6) UI/UX issues in all graphs and reports. 

(1) total single bar graph as default 
(2) Month Ranges and Default current  FY


due date should be considered in approval process
accounting month for bill
number cards for new & raised bills in each sub queues n master bill queue

revenue realisatiom month



1. graphs n numbers cards list. (basing on list, I can define the graph n parameters to use)
1) How much dev time is left and how many more graphs can we include. This  depends on other work to get things correct. So I need you to tell me how much time is there for new things to be included.


2. ACL (i can think but to what user roles we limit should come from you)
On Point 2) all things that can get data bad and cannot be allowed need to be restricted. We can use Executive, Manager and Admin roles. Where executive has no permission to add anything. Manager has little authority over things and admin has the highest. You can decide these based on this outline for all areas of work. Let me know if you need any more information .

Bookings - create booking, cancel booking, edit contract, approve contract, confirm contract, cancel future confirmed contract, 					raise invoice, edit invoice, add payment, edit payment, expansion/reduction booking, contract renewals, send notifications, 			onboarding booking, exit request booking, edit/add asset damages, edit/add other deductions, approve final statement, 
			create resource booking, add credits, cancel resource booking, mark resource booking completed, add employees, edit employees
	
Accounts -  add/edit expense codes, add/edit recurring payment, view reports, 
			edit credit entry, approve credit entry, add bill queue item, edit bill queue,  gst posting data to billqueue, map bill images, archieve bill queue, 

Purchases - 


3. UX improvements (no idea at all, we need to external thoughts on improving it)
Point 3) we can just check spelling mistakes and format issues first. This can be the scope for now before we engage any third party

will get all tooltips n notes and will check for all validations n list column formatting.
any suggestions on current graphs n cards from team will be addressed.


4. Company Controls (need your inputs)
Point 4) this is to create a company (another co working company) and initial set up so they can go ahead and use the system), control their usage like allow, block for now.

so we need to create a master admin menu where we can create companies and show have provision to give access to only specific modules. as of now we dont have control on modules, but we need to get control of enabling n disabled modules for a company as a master admin


----------------------------------------------------

1. no new functioanlity
2. add terminology, status flow diagrams, report descriptions
3. make sure UX is clean, to make it easily understandable
4. menu items
5. number formats, decimals, aligns, heading styles, sorts, 
6. filters, counts to increase visual impact
7. all should be in proportionate in scales
8. add more number cards which are giving some alerts
9. logs n audits to track status change
10. exceptional should be logged on server
11. internationlise / currency, timezone, number format

frgt password


red, green, expected value

in view dates, show approved by n raised by in popup only and remove from outside view //
gst verification should be moved to seperate menu and need to enter all data again for verification //
accept all gstr-2 files and make dashboards to view which are mismatching with posted gst values //
remove tax invoice from gst posting modal //
seperate out all invoice basic data, gst posting data into 2 differnt modals and dont show basic data to gst posting data //
sitemanager, from site manager, will update milestone as completed, and then project manager will approve
change released to completed
projects (manager, head), cashflow (executive, manager), accounts(executive,manager) => this is the flow we need to follow for milestore approval to payout flow.
change invoice labels to taxable amount,taxamount, invoiceamout, tds, payableamount (A+B=C-D=E) //
follow same column names at invoice items level with same above terms //
need to get tds calculations at vendor level  //
set due dates should be in different dates  //
no need to show TDS obligations on top of milestones //
remove gst slabs to an invoice in the list, just totals should be fine in list n show it in modal //
also show tds slabs for all items applicable in that po in modal view by clicking on tds amount ??
show paymnet holder flag, tds applicable on vendor label in top line. 
expected completion date, milestone completion date -> change terms //
expected completion date, should ask for relative change of subsequent terms actual date changes and relatively milestone completion date should change as per its expected completion date. //
expected date should be given while raising PO and should be to vendor to agree //
whenever a milestone is released, we need to set actual date for that milestone. //
actual date should be changed only if expected date is greater than actual date..  //
and while approving milestone, manager should be triggered about this date change n ask if he wish to change further expected dates//
